# TODO

* Decide if keeping 8MHz oscillator.
* Review PCB layout one last time and make any last minute corrections.
* Remove superfluous 1k Resistor after 
* Correct RV1 (pot in backwards currently) and add Tapering resistor
** [Geofx Secret life of Pots][1]
** Rt = R/b. Where R = 1k (total pot resistance), and 4 <= b <= 5. Using b = 4, Rt = 250 Ohms, and we can use 220 Ohms to get b to be between 4 and 5.
** Resistance will vary between 180 Ohms and 1kOhms in a somewhat logarithmic way (close enough to the ear).
