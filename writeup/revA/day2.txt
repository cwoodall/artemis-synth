# Day 2

* Started off with them all coming into the room and getting back to there appropriate tables.
  We allowed them to talk and for those who were finished to show off for a little while.

* Once everyone was settled down we figured out which groups were done and which still needed
  to finish soldering. Some of the soldering fixes that needed to be made were difficult, a
  few boards become irreperably damaged; however, everyone ended up leaving with a finished
  board.

* Sam and Chris gave a talk about how to use the synthesizers and how to program them using
  the web programming rig (edf.bu.edu/synth). This was after lunch and the girls payed 
  attention, but were not all super interested. Once we gave them a rundown of the boards
  we let them go off and play with them
  
* Problems: 
** Volume too low for the most part. Needs to be fixed in future revisions. A constant complaint.
** Web programming rig was effective, but I have some concerns about the actual useability of it.
