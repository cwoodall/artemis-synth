# Day 1

* Started off with Eric introducing everyone, split up into groups by table 3
  to a soldering iron. Tables included needle nose pliers, wire cutters, 
  soldering irons, a vice, solder, blank protoboards and some junk resistors.

* Rework station for the mentors/helpers: soldering iron, solder braid, more
  solder and extra parts
  
* Eric talked about electronics: Basic what is a LED, Diode, Resistor,
  capacitor. All from an applied perspective, in terms of what are they used
  for more than, how to use them or what maths govern them. Then an introduction
  into what a microcontroller is and what the Synthesizer board looks like and
  will eventually do.

* Eric went over basic soldering saftey and how to. (Slides to be posted with
  writeup).

* Started practicing. Artemis girls in general graspsed the basic process of
  soldering very fast and it was rather impressive. Some had trouble at first,
  or were nervous/scared, but these fears were widly overcome

* Limited errors, some rework needed to be done

* Problems:
** Putting polarized parts in the wrong way.
** We did not have 28pin sockets so we used 2 14 pin sockets so some were
   not aligned properly. CHECK YOUR BOM!!! DON'T FORGET THINGS.
** No 8 pin sockets so if the DAC or Amp were put in wrong a lot of effort 
   needed to go into rework. SOCKET ALL PINS.
** Some had issues getting R10 into place correctly and bending. It is a 
   polarized part and needs to be put in right. ALSO it is NOT LABELED... this
   is bad... Needs to be redesigned

* About 6 finished, the Artemis organizers had only soldered once or twice 
  before so the groups where the mentors were EDF veterans moved the fastest
  by far. My group came in 1st in getting everyone finished, Sam's group
  had the first girl to finish at all.

* Very fun, girls seemed to like it.
