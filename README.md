## Hardware

Schematic and PCB files were made using KiCAD. Gerber files and PDFs are available. The schematic files were created using a 25 mil grid and are sometimes off by 25 mils from the 50 mil grid. It is advised that you also use a 25 mil grid when editing the schematic files.

There is a basic convention for digital signals on the PCB layout, which is the bottom layer travels vertically and the top layer travels horizontally.
