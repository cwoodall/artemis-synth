Hello Artemis Organizers,

So I remember you saying that we could send you some questions for a survey of
our own. I assume you can give it to them sometime after Tuesday. We at the
EDF want to continue to develop this thing in a direction that would better
represent its educational goals and purpose. So here are some questions, feel
free to edit and rephrase them:

* Did the activity take to long? Yes or No
* Did it feel too complex? Yes or No
* How interested were you in electronics before? Scale from 0 to 5 (or something)
* How interested are you in electronics now? Scale from 0 to 5
* Did you know how to solder before? Yes or No
* Do you now feel comfortable with soldering now? Scale from 0 to 5
* How could the kits be made more entertaining? Text based answer
* Was music an appropriate subject? If not what would you have preferred to 
  build? Yes or No and text
* Any additional comments? text

Feel free to add any more questions you want to ask them or edit/move/combine
questions.

From,
Chris W.
