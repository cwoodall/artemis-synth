# Problems:

* Putting polarized parts in the wrong way.
* We did not have 28pin sockets so we used 2 14 pin sockets so some were not aligned properly. CHECK YOUR BOM!!! DON'T FORGET THINGS.
* No 8 pin sockets so if the DAC or Amp were put in wrong a lot of effort 
   needed to go into rework. SOCKET ALL PINS.

* Some had issues getting R10 into place correctly and bending. It is a 
   polarized part and needs to be put in right. ALSO it is NOT LABELED... this
   is bad... Needs to be redesigned

* Volume too low for the most part. Needs to be fixed in future revisions. A constant complaint.
* Web programming rig was effective, but I have some concerns about the actual useability of it.
